# Particle-Swarm-Optimization

A neat implementation of Particle-Swarm-Optimization in C++ from scratch. Refer [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhgDMAm-imI) to know more about PSO. To get a full grasp of this repository you need to have a working hand in C++ but if algorithm is your only need then jump to [this](double PSO::Optimize(PSOTestFunction function,) directly.
